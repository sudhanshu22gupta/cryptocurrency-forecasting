# Cryptocurrency Forecasting

## Goal:

While market inefficiencies and the influence of public sentiment regarding cryptocurrencies present challenges, technical analysis offers the potential to identify and exploit patterns and trends that may elude traditional fundamental analysis. By leveraging daily historical price data of Bitcoin (BTC) and incorporating technical indicators such as Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Bollinger Bands (BBS), and Relative Strength Index (RSI), this thesis aims to develop robust trading strategies. The performance of the developed trading strategies were assessed over a six-month period, January 2022 to June 2022, considering both risk and returns â€“ application of technical analysis yields superior performance compared to a simple buy-and-hold approach.
